### Kyle ###

22 year old male from San Diego, California

Cashier at Albertson's, B.A. in Psychology

Kyle works part time at his local grocery store to get some experience and money while preparing his application to go back to school to get his master's degree. Kyle is usually quite introverted, spending a lot of his time immersed in fantasy stories like *Lord of the Rings*, both the movies, in which he owns the full trilogy extended edition on BluRay, as well as the books. He lives with two roommates in an apartment in San Diego, both of which he met at his school's board game club while he was there as an undergrad. 

While at the RPG club, an acquaintance of his introduces him to the show *Critical Role*, and Kyle's creative itch explodes. Seeing Matt Mercer create his own fantasy world, and thinking of other universes Kyle was in love with like Middle Earth, he decided to give it a shot and started running a game of Dungeons and Dragons with his fellow clubmates. After the campaign ended, many of the players began graduating, including Kyle himself, and drifted apart from eachother. Kyle still loves the game, and wants to begin a new epic campaign, and while his roommates might be interested, do not number enough people to get a game going.

Goals:
 - Find at least 2 more peopled willing to join in his session
 - Make sure that all the players give the same amount of effort, as there were players in his old game that did not put as much time and thought into the game
 - Meet some new people that share in his relatively niche hobby
