### Greg ###

34 year old male from Hell, Michigan.

District Manager for Wendy's

B.A. in Business Management

Most week days, Greg is on the road travelling to various Wendy's chain locations. His job is to assist managers and provide direction to improve business and customer retention. He is a loving father of one, and devoted husband to his wife, Rose. Most of his friends have been made through work, and it is difficult for him to let his guard down while socializing with employees. He only has two secrets he keeps from his friends and employees: he loves Dungeons and Dragons, and he prefers to cook his own burgers at home.

He had dabbled in tabletop role playing games in the past, but that was over a decade ago. He wishes to get back into the game, but is unsure of where to look, and who to play with. On occasion, on his way home from Ann Arbor, he would visit a comic book store. A table in the back was usually full, but approaching a seemingly tight-knit group felt intimidating. He wishes there were an easy way to find players who would accept his experience level and let him play, all while relearning the game.

Goals:
- Find a group of similarly experienced players to enjoy a tabletop game
                                                                                      
- Make friends who share the same interests (non work-related)                                                                                                      
- Learn the game through weekly sessions to eventually become a Game Master himself
