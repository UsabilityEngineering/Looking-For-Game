# Requirements Gathering

## Methods
The first method we used to gather data was a questionnaire sent out to other students in the UX class, as well as online friends who have an interest in tabletop role-playing games.  We used this method because it provides relatively accurate quantitative data that will be a valuable asset when we decide which aspects of the product to focus on building.  Surveys are also very inexpensive to produce and send out to potential users.  Additionally, users that already have experience in the tabletop RPG scene can show us what a typical player/game master would be looking for. We were able to survey 11 people with this method.

The second method used for data gathering was holding a focus group. We had some quantitative data from the original questionnaire, but we wanted to gain some insight into the reasoning behind the player's preferences and desires.  Using this method ensures everyone's voices are heard, and we can explore the problem space in a more in-depth manner. Furthermore, with two distinct classes of users, having a focus group for each one helps make sure that both categories have their voices heard in an even manner. Each focus group was held with 5 users.

## Findings
From the data gathered in the survey we put out, we found some interesting data, although with a few caveats. Every response has listed Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition as a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) that they have previously played. This data, however, is not overly surprising, as Dungeons and Dragons is by a wide margin the most popular TTRPG on the market, and many of the survey responses came from people who were in the same group for playing said game. Notably, a sizeable amount of responses, about a third of responses in the section, have listed a custom TTRPG, and over half of the responses have listed games outside of Dungeons and Dragons.
