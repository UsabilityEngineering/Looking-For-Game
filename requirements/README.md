# Requirements Gathering

## Methods
The first method we used to gather data was a questionnaire sent out to other students in the UX class, as well as online friends who have an interest in tabletop role-playing games.  We used this method because it provides relatively accurate quantitative data that will be a valuable asset when we decide which aspects of the product to focus on building.  Surveys are also very inexpensive to produce and send out to potential users.  Additionally, users that already have experience in the tabletop RPG scene can show us what a typical player/game master would be looking for. We were able to survey 11 people with this method.

The second method used for data gathering was holding a focus group. We had some quantitative data from the original questionnaire, but we wanted to gain some insight into the reasoning behind the player's preferences and desires.  Using this method ensures everyone's voices are heard, and we can explore the problem space in a more in-depth manner. Furthermore, with two distinct classes of users, having a focus group for each one helps make sure that both categories have their voices heard in an even manner. Each focus group was held with 5 users.

## Findings
From the data gathered in the survey we put out, we found some interesting data, although with a few caveats. Every response has listed Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition as a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) that they have previously played. This data, however, is not overly surprising, as Dungeons and Dragons is by a wide margin the most popular TTRPG on the market, and many of the survey responses came from people who were in the same group for playing said game. Notably, a sizeable amount of responses, about a third of responses in the section, have listed a custom TTRPG, and over half of the responses have listed games outside of Dungeons and Dragons.

From the chart above, half of the respondents preferred online play, while 70% either preferred online play or had no strong preference. As we are planning to keep the service for online play, at least at the start, this shows a sufficient amount of people willing to play online.

Of the people surveyed, a vast majority of people said that they typically were player characters, as opposed to game masters. The approximate ratio of game master to player in the survey was 1:5.5. But, when asked about what peoples' ideal group size were, a large majority of responses were between 4-5 players. If this trend holds for a larger group, then there will be more players than might be able to find a game, assuming each game master only hosts one game on the site, which, while not guaranteed, is a potential point of concern.

Onto the specific sections for game masters. Everyone who responded as a game master had listed experience level very highly, both responding with a 5 on the Likert scale when asked on how important they think it would be. The other responses were somewhat more varied, and shown in the graph below. Also, both of them found finding and maintaining a fun group difficult, and could benefit from a service that could improve that experience. In terms of administration options, there was data collected but the information found in the focus group was better, as it was more open ended.

From the player section, there is a lot more variance in the responses. 75% of players wanted session lengths to be 3 hours or longer. Most had not used any group finding methods other than friends and acquantances, although a few others were mentioned, such as Roll20 and Discord, although both of these only once, and by the same person. Customization options here were more varied than with the game masters, although with a much larger sample size, seen in the graph below. Finally, all players are either favorable or neutral towards a group finding service.

From the focus group, there were some more in-depth findings. One very notable one was an option to report others, either a problem player or game master, and the ability to drop out of campaigns that were not initially thought of. On top of this, they recommend guidelines be put in place to help people, especially newer ones when it comes to finding a group in which they are uncomfortable. They also came up with a very comprehensive list of things they would want to see before either posting a game or finding a game. One important thing for them is that the game masters should already have some plan in place, although it does not have to be final or exact, before posting it on any group finder. This is because they have had experiences where one person is interested and offers to run a game, but does not have everything in place by the time they had players commit to it, and end up waffling on ideas and canceling. In terms of options, the most important ones to them were time availability, trigger warnings, and some way for the game master and prospective players to communicate what their expectations are from each other. Next on the list of important information is what kind of game is being run, both system, or what actual game is being played, and genre, experience level, and beginner friendliness, and short blurbs about each person involved so that they could have an idea of what people they might be playing with. Finally, some nice to have information includes having a miscellaneous questions tab that some people liked using to see what kind of players are applying and to have a sense of how much creativity and roleplaying they are comfortable with, how open the campaign will be, from a full open-world sandbox to a more linear, railroaded story. On top of this, some inclusivity features were brought up, such as having games be marked as LGBTQIA+ friendly.

## Caveats
In general, we surveyed people mostly from the course, as well as those who are general savvy with technology.  Additionally, those we surveyed were almost completely within a similar age group (about college age), which will have somewhat of an influence on what they believe is most important in a Tabletop RPG campaign group finding product.  If we were to include some individuals of a different age group, who might have children of their own, their expectations and wishes may be different than our data suggests.

The data that we recieved from the questionnaire may have some caveats, such as respondents perhaps not taking the time to provide completely honest/accurate answers.  The amount of people that took the survey could prove to be an issue too, as only 11 people took the survey. As mentioned in the paragraph above, the demographic that took the survey could create bias in the data moreso in this format than our focus group.

Some problems that could possibly stem due to using the focus group method for data gathering is groupthink.  While in a focus group, people are easily susceptible to just agree with the first opinion that is expressed, which could influenced the data to some degree.  Additionally, the focus group that we held involved people that already had familiarity with one another, which could further add to any biases found within our data.
