### Robert ###

21 year old male in Sacramento, California
Graphic Designer at Design Octopus
B.A. in Graphic Design

Robert loves his career, as well as his daily routine.  As a graphic designer, he gets flexible hours and is able to work from home most days.  Although he has his dog Charlie by his side every day, Robert still loves to get out and socialize with like-minded people.  One day, when he was offered by a customer to drop in on a local Dungeons & Dragons campaign that weekend, he was ecstatic!  

Since that day, he looks forward to his Saturday sessions every single week, making fast friends with everyone there.  After years of amazing times, Robert has been able to find an outlet for socialization that works well with his work schedule.  However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the group has been put on hold, and he still would like to meet new people and participate in a DnD campaign in some fashion.

Goals:
- Find an online alternative to participate in Tabletop RPG games such as Dungeons & Dragons                                                                                       
- Make new friends that allow him to be himself while away from work at home                                                                                                       
- Feel as though he is contributing to something exciting
