### Kyle ###

22 year old male from San Diego, California

Cashier at Albertson's, B.A. in Psychology

Kyle works part time at his local grocery store to get some experience and money while preparing his application to go back to school to get his master's degree. Kyle is usually quite introverted, spending a lot of his time immersed in fantasy stories like *Lord of the Rings*, both the movies, in which he owns the full trilogy extended edition on BluRay, as well as the books. He lives with two roommates in an apartment in San Diego, both of which he met at his school's board game club while he was there as an undergrad. 

While at the RPG club, an acquaintance of his introduces him to the show *Critical Role*, and Kyle's creative itch explodes. Seeing Matt Mercer create his own fantasy world, and thinking of other universes Kyle was in love with like Middle Earth, he decided to give it a shot and started running a game of Dungeons and Dragons with his fellow clubmates. After the campaign ended, many of the players began graduating, including Kyle himself, and drifted apart from eachother. Kyle still loves the game, and wants to begin a new epic campaign, and while his roommates might be interested, do not number enough people to get a game going.

Goals:
 - Find at least 2 more peopled willing to join in his session
 - Make sure that all the players give the same amount of effort, as there were players in his old game that did not put as much time and thought into the game
 - Meet some new people that share in his relatively niche hobby

### Robert ###

21 year old male in Sacramento, California
Graphic Designer at Design Octopus
B.A. in Graphic Design

Robert loves his career, as well as his daily routine.  As a graphic designer, he gets flexible hours and is able to work from home most days.  Although he has his dog Charlie by his side every day, Robert still loves to get out and socialize with like-minded people.  One day, when he was offered by a customer to drop in on a local Dungeons & Dragons campaign that weekend, he was ecstatic!  

Since that day, he looks forward to his Saturday sessions every single week, making fast friends with everyone there.  After years of amazing times, Robert has been able to find an outlet for socialization that works well with his work schedule.  However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the group has been put on hold, and he still would like to meet new people and participate in a DnD campaign in some fashion.

Goals:
- Find an online alternative to participate in Tabletop RPG games such as Dungeons & Dragons                                                                                       
- Make new friends that allow him to be himself while away from work at home                                                                                                       
- Feel as though he is contributing to something exciting

## Experienced Player Scenario ##

It has been a grueling week of deadlines, but Robert is excited to get together with his DnD group this coming Saturday, as they left off on a big cliffhanger the previous session.  As he sits on his couch, he receives an email from his boss.  Due to the rise of the COVID-19 Pandemic, all workdays will now be done from home.  Furthermore, his city is quite populated, so it would be best to not meet in person with his typical group.  He is curious what options may exist online to help his conundrum.

![Greg - Wendy's Crew Member](personas/greg.jpg)

### Greg ###

34 year old male from Hell, Michigan.

District Manager for Wendy's

B.A. in Business Management

Most week days, Greg is on the road travelling to various Wendy's chain locations. His job is to assist managers and provide direction to improve business and customer retention. He is a loving father of one, and devoted husband to his wife, Rose. Most of his friends have been made through work, and it is difficult for him to let his guard down while socializing with employees. He only has two secrets he keeps from his friends and employees: he loves Dungeons and Dragons, and he prefers to cook his own burgers at home.

He had dabbled in tabletop role playing games in the past, but that was over a decade ago. He wishes to get back into the game, but is unsure of where to look, and who to play with. On occasion, on his way home from Ann Arbor, he would visit a comic book store. A table in the back was usually full, but approaching a seemingly tight-knit group felt intimidating. He wishes there were an easy way to find players who would accept his experience level and let him play, all while relearning the game.

Goals:
- Find a group of similarly experienced players to enjoy a tabletop game
                                                                                      
- Make friends who share the same interests (non work-related)                                                                                                      
- Learn the game through weekly sessions to eventually become a Game Master himself

## Inexperienced Player Scenario ##

Greg's corporate boss is captivated by his continued success in improving profits. Because of Greg's great leadership and decision making, he is getting a promotion to a larger district! ...In Detroit. The commute is only an hour from Hell, but with rush hour traffic and rising gas prices, it is cheaper and less stressful for him to get a hotel room three nights a week. While sitting alone in his hotel room after a long shift and Googling "Armor plating for Honda Civic", he wonders if anyone near him would be willing to connect for a no-stakes, no-pressure tabletop game. He brought his laptop with him, so an online game wouldn't be a problem, but also also wouldn't opposed to meeting in person.
